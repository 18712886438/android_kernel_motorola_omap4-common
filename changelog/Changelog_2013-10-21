5994b61 Added todays changelog and updated full history
5913577 omap: dss: add earlysuspend handler. This potentially fixes the screen flickering after the CRC animation - if not, just fine tune the suspend value
bd20762 drivers: add exfat driver
8dcaddb omap: gpu: opp: core: enable all gpu OPPs to make them available and adjust higher core voltages
cc8d6e7 omap: gpu: opp: set only two OPPs to be active - SGX doesn't scale other frequencies than 2
3cd435b omap: gpu: Enable all GPU OPPs and disable CORE_OPP100OV to prevent log from spamming.
be0eb47 omap: gpu: Add OPP enabler macro 'omap2_get_gpu_device' to enable high OC OPP for SGX freqs
0ed30af omap: gpu: fix fuse definitions, reduce/raise core voltages, revert back to gpu max freq 384
f24d6d9 omap: gpu: final GPU frequency setting
0b27cc3 omap: gpu: fix another mistake...
4d05379 omap: gpu: Fix wrong efuse setting for CORE OPP100OV

1e7a2fb omap: gpu: Set core OV for OV request of SGX OC. Disable some IVA nitrosb OPPs for power savings
b506247 omap: gpu: remove third opp to allow 416 mhz oc

13a1f4d omap_ gpu_ fix missing OC freq
893832d omap: gpu: remove sysfs interface. We use a modified PVR-SOURCE, but this driver was moved into CM sources, so we cannot commit the change here. The common OMAP SGX sysfs interface originally provides read-only entries. These entries are getting modified for rw access which allows us to dynamically overclock the GPU frequency. Trickster Mod supports this interface for GPU settings change and we can use modified frequency_limit entry for OC.
