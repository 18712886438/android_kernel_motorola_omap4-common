ae6bb47 BLX: Try new config
1206a83 Battery Friend / CPUFREQ: Fix typo
1ed00cf Battery Friend / CPUFREQ: Lock the min/max frequencies - this should fix the overall behavior and doesn't need the frequency lock feature from App side
3a0f1d0 Battery Friend: Fix accidently wrong definition The old config was controlled by an extra option. I forgot to remove/rename it - that's why early suspend didn't work for CPU

56cb71b Added todays changelog and updated full history
820b0fa Battery Friend: Move needed functions for governor change to early suspend area
8eb98da Battery Friend: Extended with dynamic hotplug function. When Battery Friend is ON it will always turn OFF CPU1 during suspend (screen off) - but it will never allow to turn off CPU1 during active state (screen on). The code also protects against conflicts between using battery friend + a hotplug governor (which isn't a goot idea though). When Battery Friend is disabled the governor will be switched to hotplug during suspend and the prior governor will be restored on resum.

5233529 mm: vmscan: remove unimplemented above_background_load
4235893 When reading from large files through the generic file read functions into page cache we can detect when a file is so large that it is unlikely to be fully cached in ram. If that happens we can put it on the tail end of the inactive lru list so it can be the first thing evicted next time we need ram.
f63bea5 Add a background scanning timer to restore the watermarks to the pages_lots level and only call on it if kswapd has not been called upon for the last 5 seconds. This allows us to balance all zones to the more generous pages_lots watermark at a time unrelated to page allocation thus leading to lighter levels of vm load when called upon under page allocation.
4163e35 When kswapd is awoken due to reclaim by a running task, set the priority of kswapd to that of the calling task thus making memory reclaim cpu activity affected by nice level.
c0c2ace While it may be nice to have a copy of pages on swap once written there, the more garbage we leave in the swapspace the slower any further writes and reads to and from it are. Just free swapcache whenever we can.
b6ce786 Swap Token: Only allow its effect when swap is half full. It's only useful for conditions of swap trash
a3d5b7b Swappiness: Set to 10 - Never seen a desk which benefits from a high swappiness, but setting to 0 can cause weird behavior. Set it to 10.
