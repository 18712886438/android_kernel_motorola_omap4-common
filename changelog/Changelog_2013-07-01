4b3f259 AdaptiveX set to default governor - best for power saving as it only turns off the second core during idle/sleep mode and keeps both cores awake on active state. Hotplugging eats power when switching on/off the secondary core(s) all the time when phone enters low tasks state. Better keep the core awake and suspend it in sleep mode only.
67c1010 Added todays changelog
5260c0e New modified zcache driver, more non-hotplugging governors for power saving
fb0e1d3 Revert "Revert back to prior zcache version"
76a249a Add missing library for dynamic interactive
ce3b91a Enable zcache - Now we have a stable config and sorted out the reason for sound crashes. The virtual clocks for iva and dsp were causing a system crash and alsa routing to be failed. Now we have to figure how zcache and uksm will work together.
