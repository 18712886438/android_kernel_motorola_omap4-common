43058dc ARM: 7668/1: fix memset-related crashes caused by recent GCC (4.7.2) optimizations
264c49d [PATCH 1/3] Rename ARM assembler push/pull macros The ARM assembler library functions use a macro called push that along with a macro called pull is used to shift bytes around in a word in an endian-independent way. However, the modern unified ARM assembler syntax also defines the instruction push to push data onto the stack, which has specific encodings in the Thumb2 instruction set. For prevent possible conflicts going forward, and to allow the use of the more transparent push instruction along with the modern unified assembler syntax, this patch renames all occurrences of the push macro to pushbits, as well as renaming the macro argument, when also called push, to pushshift.
