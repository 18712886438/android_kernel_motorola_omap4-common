The common OMAP SGX sysfs interface originally provides read-only entries. These entries are getting modified for rw access which allows us to dynamically overclock the GPU frequency. Trickster Mod supports this interface for GPU settings change and we can use modified frequency_limit entry for OC.

bd9a4ad omap: iommu: program constraints based on platform data IOMMU driver requests and releases constraints in iommu_get and iommu_put respectively. These constraints are actually needed only on OMAP4 and beyond for sub-systems that have an AMMU. The current driver code has these values hard-coded for all the chips.
28183b9 omap: iommu: apply latency constraint based on power domain When the iommu is taken out of reset, a latency constraint is set to avoid its power domain going to retention/off. The iommus for DSP and M3 reside in DSP and Core power domains respectively, and therefore the API for setting the constraints is different. This patch uses the appropriate API depending on the iommu (power domain) the latency constraint is being applied on.

82e8d66 [PATCH 1/3] Rename ARM assembler push/pull macros The ARM assembler library functions use a macro called push that along with a macro called pull is used to shift bytes around in a word in an endian-independent way. However, the modern unified ARM assembler syntax also defines the instruction push to push data onto the stack, which has specific encodings in the Thumb2 instruction set. For prevent possible conflicts going forward, and to allow the use of the more transparent push instruction along with the modern unified assembler syntax, this patch renames all occurrences of the push macro to pushbits, as well as renaming the macro argument, when also called push, to pushshift.
