820b0fa Battery Friend: Move needed functions for governor change to early suspend area
8eb98da Battery Friend: Extended with dynamic hotplug function. When Battery Friend is ON it will always turn OFF CPU1 during suspend (screen off) - but it will never allow to turn off CPU1 during active state (screen on). The code also protects against conflicts between using battery friend + a hotplug governor (which isn't a goot idea though). When Battery Friend is disabled the governor will be switched to hotplug during suspend and the prior governor will be restored on resum.
